#   Portfolio 1

Following completion of my first HTML + CSS project, I wanted to make a portfolio to compile my projects and show my journey learning to code.

This project was really fun! I learned a lot more about formatting code and was able to create this sleek smart and simple portfolio.

As I complete more projects I will be adding them to this portfolio.
